# Remove Greek Accents for Sublime Text

Using Sublime Text's built-in "Convert to Upper Case" for Greek is not very convenient since capital letters in Greek don't require accents. It's easy to change from `Ελληνικά` to `ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΆ` but then you need to change `ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΆ` to `ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ`, which means more typing. This package automates the process of removing accents from your selection.


## Usage

Keyboard friendly:

* OSX/Windows/Linux: Select some text and type `Ctrl+Shift+'`.
* The command is also available in Sublime's command palette. E.g. on OSX, select some text, then `Cmd+Shift+P`, type `Greek` to filter commands and press enter.
* It works with multiple selections too.

Mouse friendly:

* Make a selection and open the context menu (right-click), then select "Remove Greek Accents"
* Make a selection and go to the Edit main menu, then select the "Remove Greek Accents" option there.

You need to select some text for the command to work. If you want to remove accents from an entire file, select all the text then run the command using one of the options above.
